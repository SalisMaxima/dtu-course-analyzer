# Data Directory

This directory contains scraped and processed course data.

## Files

- `coursenumbers.txt` - List of all DTU course numbers (generated by `getCourseNumbers.py`)
- `coursedic.json` - Raw scraped course data with grades and reviews (generated by scrapers)
- `data.json` - Processed analysis results with percentiles (generated by `analyzer.py`)

## Note

These files are generated by the data pipeline and are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`).
They will be created when you run the scraper and analyzer.

## Pipeline

1. Run `python auth.py` to authenticate
2. Run `python getCourseNumbers.py` to fetch course list → creates `coursenumbers.txt`
3. Run `python scraper_async.py` to scrape data → creates `coursedic.json`
4. Run `python validator.py coursedic.json` to validate data
5. Run `python analyzer.py extension` to analyze → creates `data.json` and extension files
